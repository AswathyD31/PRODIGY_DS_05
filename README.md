# **Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech**

## **Task 5 Submission:**

Welcome to my submission for Task 5 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. This project performs data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the US Accidents (2016â€“2021) dataset.
The dataset contains information about traffic accidents in the United States, including location, time, weather conditions, and road features.
The goal is to discover trends, patterns, and insights that can help in understanding accident severity and factors contributing to road incidents.

## Dataset Description
____________

* Source: US Accidents Dataset (Kaggle)

* Size: ~7.5 million accident records

* Timeframe: February 2016 to December 2021

## Key Columns:
ID, Severity, Start_Time, End_Time, Start_Lat, Start_Lng, City, State, Temperature(F), Visibility(mi), Wind_Speed(mph), Distance(mi), and road feature indicators (Bump, Crossing, Junction, Traffic_Signal, etc.).
